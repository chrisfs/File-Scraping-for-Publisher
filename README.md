# File-Scraping-for-Publisher
Code written to scrape 2000 page documents and create more workable documents

Pdf2split.py :  This is a script I did for a publshing company. It looks through a 2000 page report on author royalties and separates it into many different documents, one for each author paid during that month. The former process was to copy and paste by hand so this script sped up the process immensely. 

Makecsv111NEW.py :This script takes a huge text file generated from the same PDF file, finds a few fields and produces a csv file for import into Excel. I put comments throughout in response to client concern about a need for future changes.
